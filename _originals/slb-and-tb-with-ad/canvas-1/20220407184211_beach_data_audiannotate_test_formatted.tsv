0:0:00		" um just let me know. Alrighty. So my first question,"
0:0:05		 I knew that would happen. That's why I have to cover. Mhm. I might have done it a few times myself.
0:0:19		 I try to keep it close. We have a few white shirts that have really funny stains on.
0:0:23		" Yes, but I can't wear white shirts. White shirts, white shirts on these days, at least your computer's okay."
0:0:32		" Oh yes, yeah, it's pretty it's pretty hardy already. So I just wanted to go over some basics first."
0:0:38		" So you are timothy beach and you're Cheryl Beach, correct? Yes."
0:0:43		 I published Cheryl Lee's Outer Beach after beach. Yes. Yeah. I have your full name written down here.
0:0:48		" Um and then you're both professors in the Geography and Environment, Environment Department."
0:0:55		 And I know you're on I think at least a couple of planet Texas 2050 projects.
0:1:00		" So the one I wanted to talk about today is the resources, stress and population dynamics in pre modern urban environments project."
0:1:08		" And then here I have just some notes and this is we were gathering this information I think from some Natalie's conversations previously, as well as the proposal that was submitted."
0:1:19		" So, what I have noted in like what the goal of the research that you're doing or you're involved in is um to investigate the Maya Region water management and investigate climate and water management in the city of Rome."
0:1:31		 So these two different locations and then The other one and you said you're not going to talk about this one this time is the Texas Water Stories one.
0:1:40		" Okay, that's the one that we actually did that we did field work for both."
0:1:45		 The Rome one and that other one that's taking place in Sicily okay.
0:1:49		" With a connection to the water stories are also Okay, Okay."
0:1:55		" That's one that we were familiar with that project, but ours was using."
0:2:02		" It's also pre modern connection as well, but it comes up very much to the modern, but that was part of our societies, but also part of the pre modern urban environments."
0:2:15		" So we put a good amount of work into that. In fact, I have a lot of data in the lab right now."
0:2:22		" And so those data, would you be using the same data for both projects just in different ways?"
0:2:28		" Or is this kind of different, different things that are quite different things."
0:2:32		 This one is very much associated with an ancient to modern society and its water resources stresses and environmental stresses as an analog for texas.
0:2:46		 Um and there are some very interesting analogies between the mediterranean and the texas health countries.
0:2:52		 So we focus it on the texas Hill country. Um and and there is a presumption that that work would then go into the hill country to compare data at some point.
0:3:02		 We haven't done that yet. I've never worked and never worked in the United States and Since 1989 works in international because I was in the school of international affairs before.
0:3:11		 And one requirement for the scientists in the school of international affairs was too.
0:3:16		" Yes. Yeah. So this just helps me see which branch of the work it is and that does include the work in history to Romania with Adam as well, which is going to take place in your tooth and you're one was Rome and you too will be pleased with Astrid and Eleanor Harrison Beck."
0:3:41		 And I do see that fred Valdez has some DNA stuff down here too.
0:3:45		" Yeah. So we spoke with fred last week, him and Angela Angelina Angelina."
0:3:51		" Yeah, yeah. About their their part of the good and I'll see them on Wednesday for a follower and perhaps you've talked about the texas water stories already with anybody."
0:4:01		" But no, I'm just focusing on this project. Somebody else's paul next to us right next to his."
0:4:06		" Part of that. Okay. Between us, we Cover about 40% of that so far."
0:4:13		 It's very actively working. I think that will be good to learn about because we're at least attack from the conversations I've had.
0:4:21		 So I work with Suzanne Pierce for the most part. So she's kind of the one who guides where I should be focusing and what we're talking about.
0:4:29		" Um so we haven't been discussing that project very much so from the tax side, we're just not very aware of what's going on right now because of the nature of it being more of a humanistic one."
0:4:41		" It may not have as many requirements, but there are definitely data and it's very much from their historians."
0:4:50		" There are, I don't know what Nikola is. She works on indigenous peoples rights and knowledge and information."
0:4:59		 And then there's paul who is a communication scholar who's interviewing people what they know about water problems and panhandle technique.
0:5:09		" Well, it's panel texas, right. And then I'm doing more traditional geo archaeology to look at this in deep time."
0:5:21		 Most of the problems that you can see and study in Sicily are today.
0:5:27		 So most of them relate directly to today when we're trying to dig that back as far enough so that we get a deep time understanding of But you're not really worried about that.
0:5:35		" So put that on the side of your mind. Yeah, we've been trying to sort all these out."
0:5:41		" So yeah, it's okay if there's some crossover and I just wanted to scope it a little bit."
0:5:47		 One more point about that. Is is that what we're doing on?
0:5:49		 It will be the same data requirements that we'll talk about from this today because it's the same kind of research is just in a different location.
0:5:59		" So everything will be similar, supporting in similar ways. Yeah. Okay."
0:6:05		" So I'm getting that the goal of the research or at least the kind of the sub project because even within the resources, stress and population dynamics project."
0:6:14		 I get the feeling that these are kind of some some projects that different researchers have and then this information that the state will be integrated in some way for a more cohesive picture.
0:6:23		 So you're concentrating on the Maya region. So this is the Belize work that folks are doing.
0:6:29		" And then Rome as part of Romania, raven taylor and with Adam rabinowitz in europe."
0:6:37		" Yes. So in all those cases, we provide the geoscience environmental science side."
0:6:43		" Two more humanities scholars. So for instance, last summer on the pilot field research with raven taylor, we visited ancient aqueducts, crumbles ruins the ends of the modern roman water systems that connect with these ancient aqueducts."
0:7:06		" The springs they draw from, we were taken around the countryside by a roman or italian."
0:7:15		 Water master has access to all these water sites. And we're looking at how ancient infrastructure is supporting modern water for the city of Rome essentially.
0:7:26		 So that's the ancient to modern connection right there. Is looking at how ancient people saw water problems for a huge empire and then how that still contributes to a modern cities needs or and how those breakdowns in those societies.
0:7:46		" What we can learn from those didn't work, delay that in texas or try to avoid that here going forward."
0:7:55		" So, so that work involves a lot of exploration um involved."
0:8:02		" So fieldwork and it involves taking water samples and the humanity side involves, you know, raven taylor climbing into a cistern and finding inscriptions on the wall."
0:8:15		" It tells when it was built or finding the impressions of reeds in another wall that shows how they when they were curing the cement they had, you know, reads or would infrastructure."
0:8:28		" So there's an architectural element, there's a historical element and then there's the geological and geochemical and d'Amore Fick element of understanding how did people know to go to these springs and how do they know they're good."
0:8:43		" But the but the real data requirement there then is the data that we bring back, take to the labs and study water chemistry or soils."
0:8:52		" Okay. So because what you're focusing on, I know there are all these different data but your focus will be on the water and the soil and those kinds of sounds and then the geological and the water and then to integrate with them to bring other forms of mapping to them."
0:9:09		 So so remote sensing and that's going to be a part of all all these parts.
0:9:14		" So we'll be working especially with our students to do um remote sensing, using the best kinds of tools we can use for that."
0:9:24		 But especially using modern laser mapping systems. But also trying to find whether there are existing data sets.
0:9:33		" We could get say from the italian government. If we to work through our Water master for instance, you might know that there are you know aerial photos, historical aerial photos."
0:9:43		 That might be helpful to build a historical picture of this or if there are other satellite imagery that are available or lidar that's available.
0:9:52		 So we could get an idea of change over time if they're historical remote sensing data sets that we can compare with the modern data that we will collect over the site.
0:10:04		 And then the other aspect like Tim said is digital mapping.
0:10:09		 So getting out there with serving equipment and global positioning systems to do accurate mapping of the locations of these ancient waterworks.
0:10:19		" Okay, Alright. So I'm getting these physical samples, the water, the soils, that kind of thing, remote sensing and then kind of this serving or mapping and mapping the underlying the way we handle that is through Arc GIS."
0:10:39		 So that's going to be the main platform that will have to be part of that system.
0:10:44		 And then um there are a couple of their the three more remote sensing platforms that we've been using called Erdos E RDS and Envy E N V I.
0:11:03		 So it allows them to bring those data together and then manipulate them in ways that then we can further map them in.
0:11:11		" Js it includes geo referencing and then and then the third part of that is one that we bought ourselves that costs a lot of money called MARS M A R S and I have to, I'm just emailing with our graduate student to see if that has come in yet."
0:11:27		" Um Okay, so MARS software is one, I'm not sure we'll need that for the broader group but we should consider it if we're if we are going to go into light or in a big way and that may very well happen depending on, well, we've already our labs in in a big way and I know that it's being done in a variety of other places and using a variety of other places, including on the pickle campus where they also have their own lidar system."
0:11:51		" Yeah, I've been hearing about that system. I don't know too much about lidar but well, I don't really know anything about later."
0:11:59		 But I know there's been some history of like people working with lidar attacks.
0:12:03		" Most of it's been for a while, you know. Yeah, it's good geologic exploration because essentially it peels off the ground cover and trees brush, which is the neat thing though, is those data that were the trees and the brush information."
0:12:22		 It's not peeled off per se. It's saved as a cloud of information that also gives you great information about biomass and forest structure that our ecology students are working.
0:12:33		" And mars is easily google mars data analysis software. Okay. And that one again, I haven't heard yet."
0:12:41		 We just got back from which probably other people on the project did from the American Geophysical Union meeting in Washington.
0:12:50		" And so they probably walked by each other three times because it's 26,000 people, but our students were there too."
0:13:02		 And so we need to reconnect and see catch up on what kinds of software that we're looking at.
0:13:11		" Okay, so I'm getting a little bit about the kind of data kind of software."
0:13:14		 And these are questions that I have. So we'll see if I kind of want to dig in a little bit more.
0:13:17		 But you're already answering a lot of things we bought and envy too.
0:13:22		 Didn't we have the department but other people have envy in our depart departmental licenses.
0:13:29		" Yeah. And they're both similar. We have global mapper already and that might be something useful because it's a fairly simple kelly has I think kelly's last but very few because it's expensive, very few."
0:13:46		" You can only rent a certain number of seats at a time with these very expensive, precise and make a ton of money off of Yeah."
0:13:59		 Works for their investors. One of the things I did want to ask is do you for the planet Texas 2050 project.
0:14:08		 Do you already have data or for any of these sites or are you still planning on going out?
0:14:14		 We have lots of data but we will be going out multiple more times the data because the project just started this summer and we were able to do an initial collection in Rome I just got the water chemistry back last the weekend before last.
0:14:30		 So we've been doing lab work and collaborating with the Jackson school with some of their instrumentation to study the water samples.
0:14:39		 So those data are just on Okay. And that's normally how we handle it.
0:14:46		 We just stored on Excel on computers in my lab. And that's mostly for these for the sample for the roman water samples.
0:14:54		" Yes, but there could end up being roman and Romania and Sicily hundreds of samples."
0:14:60		 So that then becomes with almost all the elements analyzed. So then it becomes closer and closer to a big data kind of question in that case.
0:15:09		 So when you're what kind of I will probably want to go back.
0:15:13		" But since we're on this track, um what kind of analyses are being done?"
0:15:18		 So is this isotope analysis or is this elemental compound? Isotopes?
0:15:26		 So all of those together to try to get at different kinds of questions in that case.
0:15:32		" And I also do wet chemistry on these samples. Okay, so different analytical techniques being used to essentially cross check so what I get in the lab and that cross checks with what's being done in the Jackson School on elemental elemental analysis is another elemental Complementary to one another."
0:15:57		" Isotopic and elemental. Okay, maybe we can walk through for at least the water samples or these kinds of samples what that workflow is."
0:16:04		 So I'm understanding you or your graduate students are out collecting these samples.
0:16:08		" You bring them back and then, Okay, something happens. So we collect these samples in the field, we run some basic field tests on them in terms of just basic physical information, temperature, electrical conductivity, ph we take their their location GPS point."
0:16:30		 So that's recorded in field books and then that's transferred to a spreadsheet.
0:16:36		 So it's kind of manually manually recorded while we're in the field doing these things.
0:16:40		 Then we bring those samples back to the U. S. And they go to my lab and my graduate student re does the field samples re does the field tests again as a cross check on on the initial condition of the water.
0:16:59		 Then she filters all of them and some of them are set aside for chemical analysis in my lab wet lab analysis and some of them are set aside or collect.
0:17:13		" We collect them in small special bottles, acid rinse bottles that go to the Jackson school for them to analyze using either the I."
0:17:20		 C. P. M. S. Machine or with micro as Tim said for these different isotopes.
0:17:30		 Parton's lab at Pickle then is where the pick a row and I don't know who's head of that lab.
0:17:36		" But I know Judd is our connection with Nick Miller's, our connection in the Jackson school for the analysis and we haven't done carbon isotopes on the water yet."
0:17:47		 But that's a potential thing that could be done to and that's done in precursor.
0:17:53		 I've heard that name and he does that's one isotope carbon but there are others that they can do to the work that's done internal to my lab then that would be part of the laboratory expenses are for the chemicals and supplies that go into that.
0:18:12		 I am um contributing if you will the time of my graduate assistant who the college pays for TIM also has a grad assistant whose time has contributed.
0:18:25		 We did have some funding to help in the summer though for our grad assistants to work on processing examples that came in as part of Planet texas.
0:18:33		 So we have to kind of keep track of grad student time and whether the college is paying for it or whether planet texas is paying for it and we keep that separated.
0:18:44		" But then that workflow is that you know from my lab, the water samples are taken by Greta graduate student or by Colin or other grad students to the Jackson school across the way for the other analysis."
0:18:59		" And then my lab, thank you. We use an account number since it's within the university to pay for the analysis over there."
0:19:10		" So for instance, the last batch we split the cost between The Roman samples for planet Texas off the PT 2050 account and then the samples for Belize which were not summer planet texas yet."
0:19:25		" I paid for with my own from my endowment. So we do keep track of what's getting spent where and then so the data that you get back, you get these reports back comes back in a spreadsheet from Nate miller and they're just emailing this to you or they put this inbox and you download it and how that gets those are small enough."
0:19:52		" But you're also I guess you're also managing this data that describes kind of what happened to the samples in your lab describes how they were collected and your initial kind of readings and matching that up with, you know."
0:20:04		" Yeah, metadata in the spreadsheets that describes this was sampled from the the read vault with the inscriptions on july 2nd 2018."
0:20:16		 And here's the GPS points and here's the field data and now here's the lab data.
0:20:21		 So the workflow is I've created spreadsheets over the years that show the field information in the lab.
0:20:28		" When was it filtered in the lab? There's only one spreadsheet, not multiple files in the end."
0:20:33		 I'm just trying to understand kind of where it's all living.
0:20:36		 It lives in a couple of different kinds of spreadsheets because I have my own lab spreadsheet.
0:20:42		" But then Nate miller sends his own spreadsheet back, that's the output from his machine."
0:20:47		 So then my graduate student has to work on data integration which is our plan for next for this coming spring.
0:20:56		 Um Two integrate and cross check with what we get from I.
0:21:02		 C. P versus what we have as sort of a master dataset of water chemistry so far we've put together one that it's still not perfect because people may take a sample uh in Belize uh a stream crossing and they might say oh it was the bridge across the stream and then they forget to say which bridge.
0:21:23		 So there's that and so I have to make sure These match over the years.
0:21:32		 But I have a data set going back since about 1993.
0:21:37		 It's not perfect. But I've been working now that I have a lab and a graduate assistant because it was often on at George Mason making this a more integrated data set.
0:21:49		 So I would really like to have more support and time for an integrated water quality data set as part of this and dealing with the planet texas data and making it more useful and more accessible for other researchers.
0:22:04		 So where are those data currently living when you do you manage them in ut boxes that the grad student who's kind of managing it is on your local computer.
0:22:13		 It's managed on my local computer and I have copies that I have on on thumb drives or we'll export to my my work computer and we also use google calendar and google docs to share data within our lab.
0:22:30		" Okay, Okay. Alright. Pretty Well up to date on most of the data would probably go in when we say most of the data with the data from 1991 to present."
0:22:42		" So that's long before PTT Yeah. Something because this is one of the, one of the things I'm trying to understand and think through in terms of like If we're trying to provide a cyber infrastructure or something for researchers as part of planet Texas 2050 and your work is a little bit more comprehensive where you've been doing similar things for a longer time."
0:23:01		 It's not it's not completely clear kind of what we should be asking researchers to put in planet Texas 2050 and what we could just provide a service.
0:23:09		 But it's the planet because we're at the beginning of this project.
0:23:15		" Planet texas data are easy to keep. Yeah, but I don't want to reinvent workflow or reinvent of course, yeah."
0:23:27		" Data system that not only works for planet texas, what will improve overall workflow and data storage and sharing then that would be a big benefit of planet texas participation."
0:23:43		 I guess I'm just gonna forgive me for adding one thing.
0:23:46		" And the reason why is that um if planet texas then can, can take over as an organization overarching organization to make sure that data get available because you know, commonly people collected data for years and um, they have or haven't had to make commitments to how those data we're going to be available."
0:24:10		 But if there were a way in that case that long term data that hadn't been part of plant texas that became part of that would could now be available for people to use.
0:24:19		 So I say that because we've been talking a long time about a lot of radiocarbon dates.
0:24:26		 So we have these dates from radiocarbon that are sitting out there and they're just sitting on my computer.
0:24:33		" But fortunately the radiocarbon companies keep copies of them. So they have their own files they actually have and some of those will also be part going forward of texas 2050 as well, because we're getting dates for that now too."
0:24:51		" So, you know, this, as Gerald said, this could be a very valuable thing for researchers that if this somehow becomes part of this and could be a way to show the broader impacts of plant texas 2050 100 100 researchers were able to upload data that then became available to a broader group of scientists around the world and they're all relevant to the problems that planet texas is trying to solve."
0:25:15		" Yeah, yeah, that's what we're trying to think through because the idea is that this initially will have kind of some Users that start using the system, but then to kind of grow it out and provide access to different researchers, but also allow the researchers working within the system to choose kind of who and when they share it and how much they share their data at different points in time and whether it's just with their collaborators or if it's with the planet Texas 2050 community or if at some point they want to publish the data and make it publicly or some part of it publicly available."
0:25:47		" Um so there's this kind of idea of thinking through that, that workflow over time and that's part of trying to get this information to understand what would be going in there."
0:25:55		" So the so the data go basically, you know, there's the field book stage and then there's the spreadsheet stage and essentially the spreadsheets or the lab notes stage."
0:26:05		" And I'm trying to for a deep dive. And you know, this is all blocked."
0:26:09		" Of course, because I just moved in a deep dive on, you know, I've modeled my work after, Oh, okay."
0:26:18		" Workflow of the state of California, Department of Water Resources. Water quality labs where I used to work, I've modeled my lab, the lab I had and the spreadsheets I've modeled on their water information data system, which is very outdated."
0:26:35		 Water information information system was mm hmm. I'm sure it's buried.
0:26:44		" So, um, you know, there's been a method to my madness with regards to the spreadsheets and the work that I'm using."
0:26:51		 My experience working for a state agency to um model this workflow and data flow.
0:26:59		 Okay. Yeah. That's helpful to know. Um that puts a name on it.
0:27:08		" So, there are also other types of data that you'll be dealing with."
0:27:10		" So you mentioned soil samples perhaps as well and do those go through a similar type of process where they're in the lab, they maybe get sent out for analysis."
0:27:20		" Information comes back very similar, similar workflow. We have USDA soil permits for importing foreign soil."
0:27:31		 So we have to maintain those permits and maintain quality in our labs and have our lab is inspected in order to do that.
0:27:38		 So the labs have all those data in them both in terms of spreadsheets online.
0:27:42		 But also there's there's physical space sheets in there too so that the lab inspector can come in and see exactly and she can go from the spreadsheet right to where the sample is.
0:27:55		 And Tim's lab has invented sort of the life of the soil sample.
0:28:01		 Workflow spreadsheets as well because the USDA requires you to even write down how much soil did you destroy this week as the sample cradle to grave or or you know sometimes called cradle cradle because it's possible that could be used for something afterwards.
0:28:20		" It's not just putting it in a landfill, all the landfill."
0:28:23		" So while the soils are actively being used, their archived in special cases with signs and locks and all that in our labs and there aren't you know, there aren't many people working with soils I think now at texas but there are lots of people working with sediments and lots of people working with other forms of geological and those other forms are not regulated by the USDA."
0:28:51		 And the reason why soil is it just it has lost agricultural.
0:28:57		" But if it's like the core from the bottom of the lake or the core off the shore of the ocean, those kinds of sediments are not okay."
0:29:05		 Are you gathering those as part of plant texas of course.
0:29:09		" Okay. Alright. And so most of that data when it's digital, right?"
0:29:14		" When you get these analyses, that's also just spreadsheet format for the most part, you just kind of have columns and rows of data."
0:29:20		 Okay. Okay. And it will also have geographical information like where the sample came from and or a Gps long.
0:29:29		" And that's when you manage that, that's within the file, that's within that spreadsheets."
0:29:34		" Or is it kind of a separate descriptive document? Just columns in the spreadsheet spreadsheet over time have become statistical analyses the machine um and that become tables and articles and then become articles, right?"
0:29:54		 Yeah. Ultimately these data are shared when we published them. Yeah.
0:29:57		" Yeah. I guess because from from my perspective when you when you publish the, when I see um researchers publishing data in tables within an article or something like that."
0:30:09		" That's um so that's a that's a graph, that's a table."
0:30:13		" That's something that can be copyrighted. That's something that kind of you own because you arrange those elements, they're not just facts."
0:30:19		 There's kind of more to it. There's value added. And so I think what What I want to think about at least from just the planet Texas 2050 are those data files.
0:30:28		 So those spreadsheets that you're managing and working with and how can we help you if you want to help manage those are not work with those.
0:30:36		 Okay. So we've got we've gone through that you're working with a lot of different types of data and I think more than the other folks that I was talking with.
0:30:44		 So I also want to just touch on some of the mapping of the remote sensing data for those types of data.
0:30:51		" How do you, where those stores are stored or how do you work with those and provide access to that data?"
0:30:56		 Because it's much bigger. It's bigger and we're pretty much at capacity.
0:31:01		" Okay. So we had to buy a large stand alone Pc in order to be able to manipulate our data because it's the system and it has been manipulated in chunks, the entire data file for instance, for our remote sensing lidar over Belize it's half a terabyte terabyte."
0:31:29		 Okay. And That's our beliefs 2050 right now. But what kind of scale of data that we Collected for PT 2050 GB?
0:31:43		" Terabytes, terabytes terabytes, couple of terabytes when you start adding them up."
0:31:49		 Because then what you do with remote sensing data is you make new maps and so it begins doubling and doubling and doubling spatial analysis.
0:31:59		 Yeah. So you create a new data set. That's only the tree canopy or a new data set.
0:32:07		 That's only the topography and so there you've already just doubled it or tripled it.
0:32:13		 Okay. And that for doing that I guess. I'm both curious.
0:32:18		 I'm curious about that workflow from the perspective of the Softwares that you're using and also the hardware or the systems that you're using.
0:32:25		" So you have this pc I guess. I'm also wondering if that's backed up anywhere or if you if you would like to be because I think this is the kind of data that would work well on tax systems because at that point it needs to, in my old school at Mason we were the school of computational sciences and had their own servers and much better able to handle big data."
0:32:51		 Was not doing small department like this. Yeah. I'm still learning what the setup is at.
0:32:58		 UT because I'm coming from A and M where also the department just kind of did their own things.
0:33:03		" So they had their own sensing center. Whereas here, I guess each department kind of does their own thing and sometimes provides some of its own it to researchers."
0:33:14		 But then there's also central it and then there's central. It also wants to provide services for you.
0:33:19		" But then there's also tax, so kind of it's a choice of figuring out where to go for what and what makes sense."
0:33:24		" For instance, I have asked to replace my computer since I'm no longer chair and they're offering me a computer with a hard drive that's even smaller than the current one."
0:33:34		" Oh, wow, okay. I didn't know that. Five 100 MB and they wouldn't even let me pay for it and they won't even let me pay for an upgrade with my money."
0:33:52		" This is what you get. So that's actually something at loggerheads with data, people should be thinking about is to work with those kind of entities on campus to say we have to make them understand that many do big data."
0:34:05		" They're just they're aware but it's obviously not aware because that's ridiculous, essentially 500 megabytes gigabytes."
0:34:16		" Okay. Living in the past. Alright, so so for those, for those data it would be helpful for you to have somewhere to store them, but you also need to be able to work with them."
0:34:27		" So I imagine these are particular tools that you would be using, Could you kind of wonder that a little bit the da's or the envy or the MARS tools would be or arches would be, they have to have just one thing would be reaching in and drawing a block of data and manipulating it either locally or if there's a space on the server to do that instead, then we would be doing it on the server and now our department does have some server space for mostly it's mostly taken up by classroom instruction on G."
0:35:04		" I. S and remote sensing. And so they've been doling that out, I think we have about Up to 16 terabytes of space."
0:35:13		" Eugenia is the management on that, but we've been getting like two terabytes at a time of storage space but but again you have a classroom full of 24 students, all doing different projects on G."
0:35:27		 I. S and that gets really big in terms of just the amount of data and back up and turn around space within um storage.
0:35:36		" So our department itself really should have more space, especially with regards to kelly's lab and and other remote sensing research kelly that's are there."
0:35:50		" She's environmental, she's the other, they are 2050 but their lab is a big data user and then the other big data users, Eugenio."
0:36:02		 And do you know if anyone is already using tack to do their work?
0:36:07		" I don't know. But I guess if anybody's doing it, it would be the remote sensing lab."
0:36:11		" Okay. Yeah, I can also ask around attack. It's just I'm still new."
0:36:14		" So I'm kind of figuring out who works for the most part, we've built our own remote sensing lab between our two ken labs, there's literally this is like a third lab that our department has, that's G."
0:36:28		 I. S. And remote sensing And that would be the one that would be most linked with planet Texas 2050.
0:36:35		" So yes, having server space but also secure server space because you have questions in the end about security and access and so forth with archaeological data."
0:36:48		" Um Mhm. There is a concern for security, for locations of ancient sites, worries about looting."
0:36:57		 Yes. Um And with any kind of mapping people live there now.
0:37:06		" So your public, when you published lidar and peel off the jungle."
0:37:10		 You're showing where people's houses are and their backyards remote sensing has its own kind of layer of I RB if you will privacy that geography is very aware of.
0:37:24		 And so our association has a project with the University of Michigan and I wish I could remember the name of it.
0:37:31		 But this is it's more of a kind of a social science data storage model.
0:37:37		" Is that the group, there's a data, there's a repository of University of Michigan that's designed for sensitive data like psychology and interviews with people."
0:37:48		 And so this would be the kind of care that archaeological data needs to do.
0:37:56		" You, are you aware of anyone who provides that kind of service to the archaeology community?"
0:38:02		 So I've been hearing about some repositories for data to make data publicly available within the community.
0:38:10		 But I don't know too much about if they handle sensitive data.
0:38:14		" If there's one you think is there's something called T, it's like lower case T D A R T D R."
0:38:21		 And I'm not sure whether they're storing things that have already been published.
0:38:26		" Um I, you know, this is apocryphal. But hearing people talk about publishing something called there's something called Maya map dot org."
0:38:34		" The map shows all these archaeological sites, but they've all been location alea shifted."
0:38:39		" Oh, I see for security reasons. Yes, that's one way to share data by I'm not making it completely."
0:38:46		 So those would be two that come to mind the Maya map dot org and the T D A.
0:38:51		" R. T. R. As to potential repositories because part of what we're thinking about, I'm kind of just going to progress here and might come back to some other things is um if data are being managed or stored in this platform that we're building out attack and then at some point you would like to make that data publicly available, where should the long term home or where should that data be stewarded?"
0:39:18		 Just for the elements that are being made publicly available and how is that going to be preserved?
0:39:23		 So we're considering whether we would like to link to existing data repositories and if we can manage to do that.
0:39:30		 So it's good to know what exists already and what a good from your discipline.
0:39:35		" What a good place to look at and to go to be because part of what I think about as well is what are those metadata or those pieces of documentation information that describes the data that we attack need to make sure researchers are providing to us so that when we make it publicly available, if we do that information is also there so someone can actually make use of it in an informed way."
0:39:58		 So that's that's kind of what's floating in my head as I have these conversations.
0:40:02		" Exactly. And I would say that that university of michigan model is probably in fact I brought that up a data meeting with other, my honest group with David Stewart and astrid I think fred um because of another uh huh opportunity to obtain some data that are not going to deep amount of detail on."
0:40:29		 But it could be related and it could be about data storing from texas.
0:40:35		 Yeah. So it might be sort of a so you're matching contribution?
0:40:40		" Yes. We haven't heard back from David yet on that, but we need to link with him again."
0:40:44		" David Stewart. Alright. So yeah, we don't want to reinvent a Repository system that shares data, especially if it's dealing with confidential data like Michigan one is but if the data need to be housed here and then use that as a gateway."
0:41:02		 Exactly. And that might be a model that some of the thinking that we have right now at least data stored on large for for instance the lidar data stored on large drives.
0:41:17		 Just like these external hard external hard drives and they're locked in our lab.
0:41:21		" There's another for instance, another project at U T SAn Antonio that has a large amount of lidar that one of our grad students is helping them with."
0:41:30		 Okay. So they've given us here mm hmm. So you can carry around this physical level.
0:41:37		 But we don't publish it and we don't share it because that belongs to U.
0:41:41		 T san Antonio and our student is project she's working on.
0:41:46		 Yeah. So then someone would just take this plug it into their computer and work on it.
0:41:51		 I guess their computers powerful enough work on it right locally and then kind of using our local computer.
0:41:57		 So there's this potential to be that kind of well and we do we collaborate with other projects because of the value added that our students bring as geographers and remote sensing experts to the archaeological world where they may not have a student at U.
0:42:12		 T san Antonio who can do this. Okay. Yeah. So that's the the current state of our lidar storage.
0:42:20		 So how we got that data running backwards? Um we hired the National center for laser airborne laser mapping out of University of Houston.
0:42:33		" Okay. We got bids and they were the best bid. And yeah, we have those data and almost all of it, there are some final products, but they also store those data to so they don't they didn't just give it to us in the right."
0:42:51		 So they always they always have the original archive data for all of these projects that they fly for and their University of Houston there an NSF funded research center that also has partners at UC Berkeley.
0:43:08		 And so this is this is another kind of layer of security and the original always exists there.
0:43:17		" They also do data sharing of US data for students. So there every year they put a call out for students to apply for so many square kilometers of data for their research in the United States and will provide it for free, which is sort of giving back and the broader benefits of that work."
0:43:41		 Okay. Um so that you know literally that's how they transfer the data to us because again the files are so huge do they so they send you a hard drive or give it and send it and then you can do FTp as well.
0:43:56		 Yeah I was wondering. And we keep we work with them to keep them as publishers so that we're constantly using those data and making sure their updates and then value adding to it.
0:44:09		 So they become more than data there there there there there at this point they are near to be published data but they're all managed by those data are all managed by this organization.
0:44:22		 Some basics managed and then we come up with their plane and their sensory.
0:44:27		 Yes. So we take those data and then like the raw data essentially what we come up with our maps that show things in great detail.
0:44:39		 Um So so they collected with an airplane and their sensors and they download from their sensors onto their computing system and they clean it up and provided provided and then we do the manipulation and the analysis and the value added.
0:44:57		 Yeah. So for this kind of data just so I'm clear you're thinking as part of planet Texas 2050 at least let's say that's the data that maybe we'd be able to help you store.
0:45:07		" I know you have more and maybe that's kind of a larger conversation as well, but for planet Texas 2050, it would be in the couple of terabytes size just so I have an estimate."
0:45:16		" Um if you have just arranged, the ultimate goal is to collect it for history."
0:45:22		" Historia for Romania for Alex, sorry, for adam, rabinowitz is part of the project."
0:45:29		" Also for Rome for the aqueducts, part of the project um for Sicily for Sicily water stories."
0:45:39		" So all of all of those though, and but that would probably be in the same place because water stories in texas and the one thing to think about is the those data requirements aren't that large until we and if we do get lighter."
0:45:53		" So if we don't have lighter going forward, this is in the megabytes because these are the data we talked about before in spreadsheets that we're analyzing."
0:46:00		" But once you get sensing data that then could get up to two terabytes then, but at this point hundreds of megabytes, but um or even maybe a few gigabytes, let's say."
0:46:15		" Um and each one of those projects do plan on getting next spring, but that this is part of the long term plan and then there's a new place, a new site in Belize, that's the astrid Runggaldier and Ellie Harrison book project that does not have lighter yet, but would be definitely something we're trying to get."
0:46:40		" So I would give it two terabytes purse. Well, yeah, I would say going forward and that would be that."
0:46:48		 And I just and the reason why I'm emailing right now is I'm emailing both of them so that we can talk today and I can build talk today or tomorrow so that we can build on this.
0:46:59		 We've been trying to do conference call with the external partner.
0:47:05		 Okay. Okay. I'm setting up a meeting with Astrid to have this kind of conversation in january.
0:47:11		 We will have more conversations. Will most likely talk with Astrid tomorrow afternoon and that means the rest of her team to them.
0:47:19		 And so we're setting up and again to try to get more remote sensing for her sights which are similar to what we're dealing with probably two terabytes.
0:47:27		" If we've got four potentially four sites down the road, that's eight terabytes."
0:47:32		 Okay. That's kind of an easy rule of what we're trying to do in this case is whether we have to collect it or not and that becomes another level of data as opposed to whether it's available if the roman government already has connections to obtain it.
0:47:49		" So for in terms of getting data that you wouldn't be collecting, it would mainly be this type of data that you might be getting from a government organization and we may be a private organization that does this."
0:48:00		 So we may have the purchase price and then they need to store it someplace to server space to manipulate it and do our own value added to the data.
0:48:10		 Okay. I'm assuming that with those data there would also be some probably some requirements from whoever is providing it to you in terms of who's allowed to.
0:48:30		 I just emailed Dave Stewart as well. This is reminding me of all these data connections we make while we're talking.
0:48:37		 Oh good. I'm glad they're in my mind of course to get back once we got back from you and then start doing it.
0:48:44		 But then I felt like I better do it now. That's fine.
0:48:49		 Okay. Um So what I've been getting is the folks who should have originally originally but initially have access to the data would be you and your graduate students and then potentially planet Texas 2050 collaborators here locally.
0:49:05		 Are there other folks that you're working with organizations or researchers outside of beauty that would need access to the state or need to be working with all of our collaborators may potentially.
0:49:18		" So we have collaborators at Brown University um and collaborators at Ut Tyler, Tyler and then collaborators again, University of Houston."
0:49:30		" This n. Com group universities, they already have it but they do what they want to do is they're set up by NSF to provide these data with oversight by multiple scientists so that they also want to know that these data are being used because they have strict requirements for data."
0:49:51		 Use the same kind of ones that were thinking about it might even be worth talking with and calm at some point bringing up.
0:49:58		 We have the guy we work with there are multiple good people there.
0:50:02		" But the guy we worked with, we had a nice long conversations with you as well."
0:50:07		" And it might be worth, I don't know, maybe I hope it doesn't step on toes for the people who collect lidar data at the Pickle campus."
0:50:16		 Um what's it called? The Bureau of Economic might be worth having a discussion with them and within calm to see because um I really I got the feeling and dealing with the blog that mainly they worked on oil kinds of questions.
0:50:31		 And when we went to them it was yeah we can do some work but they didn't have this deep history that these guys that these folks and calm calm has deep history flying archaeology sites.
0:50:41		" And since it's NSF it's not about making money, which I think the BCG has to be to some degree about making because it's soft money organization I'm assuming."
0:50:50		 Um And so the other one is really about how best to do research.
0:50:56		 And they do good research of E. G. I'm not saying they don't I'm just saying that they also need to make money.
0:50:60		 And I would also say for different reasons. There are data privacy issues regarding um VE Gs were because it's exploration and that's really proprietary.
0:51:13		" So they would understand real privacy issues. And you know, how do they deal with multiple researchers And the need for only certain individuals to have access the publication restrictions."
0:51:26		 So we also have an agreement with the broader group of researchers on our current lidar for Belize that as the pies tim and myself fred Valdez in archaeology and tom gutter john at Ut Tyler in Archaeology that we agree to kind of parcel out.
0:51:52		 There are some researchers who are mainly graduates of UT who don't have their own students and own projects inside fred's research area or inside Tom's research area.
0:52:02		" And we say, okay, within this zone, we will provide the lidar for you to work on as long as a, you know, there's an agreement with regards to publishing and co authorship and you do the archaeology and we do the environmental stuff."
0:52:15		" You know, there's a kind of a division of who does what with these data."
0:52:20		 So everyone has some benefits. And then there's you have five years to do something with it.
0:52:27		" And if you don't, then it reverts back to the project so that people can't just leave a black hole of no work and no knowledge out of this data set that was paid for by NSF."
0:52:39		 Yeah. So this is to help you understand that to an is um there there are people who if they find out some people have certain kinds of data.
0:52:49		" Well, just blatantly ask about using it. Even even if you haven't used it yet, it's interesting to see what kind of people do, that kind of thing."
0:52:57		" So they're at one end, there's that that kind of a thing."
0:53:01		" Um you know, and then at the other end there are people who sit on their data forever and it never gets published even though NSF paid for it and it's and it's societal information."
0:53:11		 So there's always that tension and so there's a tension. You can see the pressure to make sure you get the most out of it to make sure you've done it right.
0:53:19		" But then to make it available so the public can use it so it can move, you know, move science forward."
0:53:28		 So there's always that tension. So we have just to give you another idea.
0:53:33		 So there are people who have asked us for a data even though we haven't are not our collaborators.
0:53:40		 So you wouldn't gathered this. Please give it to you. Exactly.
0:53:43		 Well paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for it as well.
0:53:46		 So it's nice to get free information. And then and then we've also worked with people with whom we've got NSF grants who never published the data.
0:53:55		 And so we feel we feel guilty that we aren't doing what the public what we what we guarantee the public we would do.
0:54:03		 So those are our ethical considerations. So they have to be some kind of data use agreements built into these systems with latitude and understanding and so on.
0:54:23		" Yeah. Life happens. Yeah, they're meant multiple questions like this. There are there are other data as well that aren't part of plant texas, but could be going forward that our data where you you have paid somebody to analyze something."
0:54:40		 So we have people we work with who work on pollen and work on types of mollusks and a variety of things like that.
0:54:49		 And we pay them and the NSF pays them through our grants to do that.
0:54:55		 And then we're the ones who got the NSF grants that allow us to use it.
0:54:60		 And what we generally do is is we make them co authors when we write these kinds of these kinds of things.
0:55:07		" Um, but it has to be very clear on what they can be a co op, their own."
0:55:12		" What did, what value did that to the understanding of the research problem, To what degree is once they paid for it, simply the end of the contract."
0:55:23		" In other words too. Okay. So indeed, um, there would be other environmental data besides water and soil chemistry."
0:55:36		" As tim mentioned, radiocarbon dating where we pay a commercial lab to do it and they keep an archive."
0:55:42		" As tim said of the multiple labs have, we've been able to pay to do this."
0:55:48		" They keep archives of those groups are never, they never become co authors, which is again a commercial beyond what you're interested in."
0:55:59		" But it gives you an idea of where the, you know that in product boundaries happens."
0:56:04		 Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Let me take a look at what else I've got here.
0:56:19		 Do you feel like we've gone through most of the software and the computers and the hardware that you've been using for your data or something similar to everything else?
0:56:33		" We don't, again we don't have pollen data yet or molluscs data meaning they've identified the different kinds of policies which give you information as to what kind of environment it was at that particular time like in a lake core."
0:56:44		 Yeah. But we would we should going forward have those data in which case there are Softwares types of software that allow you to analyze those and there are many kinds.
0:56:59		 The one we use is something called which is the most common pollen software T.
0:57:05		 I. L. A. And um that is also run by a remarkable guy who was an Ecologist who developed the program himself.
0:57:15		 But he's also been very mindful of making sure those data get out available.
0:57:19		 And I have to look and he has and so he has set up these kind of data sharing agreements as well.
0:57:25		 And I say he and his board and the other people who work with the community.
0:57:32		 So it's a useful community look at because it's a very open one.
0:57:37		 They're trying to do they're trying to do the best thing they can for science in this case.
0:57:41		 And we have tons of these data that we've had with our projects that we're still in the process of getting to open open source at some point.
0:57:54		" Okay. So there's there's one other um speaking of philia, there's another one on the geochemical side that I don't have yet."
0:58:04		 But it's sort of what I've been struggling with with my little spreadsheets and and Excel and so forth.
0:58:12		" It's called rock wear. And that would be ideal for uh analyzing and turning our data into graphics, geochemical data, the water and the soil, geological mapping mapping our soil cores in our lake course."
0:58:32		" So like Attila that handles the environmental data, this handles the geochemical data."
0:58:37		 Are students that would be helpful for students have mainly been doing this with just programming are Yeah.
0:58:43		" Ok. Yeah, so it's our that they've been using, do they use any other?"
0:58:53		" Yeah, they use a lot of both of those because we can make those available in the city."
0:58:57		" It's not hard mat lab as you say. Okay. Yeah. And then the other, I think you have to have the same."
0:59:09		" Oh, um so the other one we used a lot of historically and we probably should use more of it and we still use a little bit is is um creaking software."
0:59:19		 So surfer surfers by golden graphics and it's connected. It's from the same company that makes rock wear.
0:59:26		" So surfer and graph for and I think again, I think are most of the students are using that because they get used to using our we've got used to using surfer and Yeah, and we've been using She has been using those things since the 80s I've been using it, so it's just easier to work with than having to program."
0:59:46		 Like it's just you get used to it in a spreadsheet format and I'm not sure what other people are doing or more senior in that case we just got used to it.
0:59:55		" I mean we're doing programming. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, grad school was different from FORTRAN and stuff like that."
0:60:05		" I've heard about those days. Yeah, no, that's that's very helpful because that's the side of things that we have the most control over."
0:60:15		" Um but my students will mainly just the, you know, they usually just go to our, I've been noticing and we've gone in and kind of work with them on that and I do fear of although I know it's very common, I do fear people just downloading our software and sticking it in and then coming up with a number that's very possible."
0:60:42		 I think everybody does that to some degree to what degree they ever go back and check the map and having a good statistics package.
0:60:51		" It'll be fine. Yeah, somebody else, you know, any of them are fine."
0:60:56		 I know everybody has a different feeling about the algorithms in them and what kind of shortcuts are taken in that.
0:61:05		 So it's probably more for a broader discussion really. I'm sure Suzanne's all over that.
0:61:14		 Well I took part in one of the data discussions for and then I tried because there's just too much going on.
0:61:20		" I tried to put one of our other colleagues into this Virginia Arema, but I don't know if he ever got invited that Eugenia was is the fantastic data scholar statistician, econometric scholar."
0:61:38		 Big data person who teaches the GIS and regression analysis and a variety of other kinds courses and programming courses too.
0:61:48		" Okay, He's right up here. He's always in his office, he takes time off for lunch."
0:61:59		 Okay. I think we've covered most of the questions I guess.
0:62:03		" I think my yeah, I think my last one right now would be whether or not there any other kind of ethical considerations that we should be sensitive to or be aware of, that that we haven't already mentioned."
0:62:23		" Big consideration. Yes, we work in central America and remote sensing can turn up information that is of interest to national security agencies and it can turn up the trails that people use for human and drug trafficking."
0:62:46		" And so there are some considerations with regards to, you know, access to what gets turned up inadvertently."
0:62:55		 And that would be a very interesting broader question. I think for a lot of people in this texas and I don't know how it affects other people because then there's a question of texas and then there's also an interesting analog.
0:63:10		" Then the border of texas, Mexico border and these are also borders of places that people come straight and come to the United States caravans and people come to the United States from those places."
0:63:24		 So that's southern Mexico and Guatemala nexus there. So what letter does then is show linear features very well that are extremely fine and that could very well be trails.
0:63:39		" So there's there's what we call this is geospatial intelligence. And so there's that aspect of it, there's a whole field of that."
0:63:48		" I don't know, I don't know what to what degree it's so at George mason where charlotte's before, there was a huge group of not a huge but a large and very active group of people working on that and getting a lot of government funding to work on that too."
0:64:03		 Mike texas A and M probably has people because it's more techie remote sensing oriented and there might be people here.
0:64:12		 But I haven't run into him yet. I haven't run into geospatial intel community yet.
0:64:17		 We've had a few people come give talks now through actually alarms of texas and gmu from the G O N.
0:64:27		" G A. And students are very interested in that as a career path, but that would be one of the kinds of agencies that that does Geospatial Intelligence."
0:64:37		 So one connection I would like to make is we have that new army group headquartered in Austin.
0:64:46		" Oh yeah, okay. So so that might be an avenue with regards to modern texas and modern other benefits of doing remote sensing in sensitive places."
0:65:00		" But you know, we work again at the nexus, the borders of three countries."
0:65:04		" Modern countries, there's the ethics of of, you know what if you discover something, is there is there some requirement for you to we don't cross the borders is what is the answer?"
0:65:20		" But I mean we don't, we don't officially, if we do a light our project in Belize then the only data that we work with is data in Belize and that's permission from the Belize government to do it from their airspace from the national security."
0:65:33		 So we get permission. That's why the archaeologists are involved because they have the permits to work in these areas.
0:65:39		" So it's not just taking a drone down there with lidar on it and flying it, we really do have to get permission and and calm is very, very up on this."
0:65:50		 They have lots of professionals who work on these questions. They get all the legal down on it beforehand.
0:65:56		" It's extremely important to them. Now. We work on all those countries on different projects and then have to recognize what the borders are and Yeah, alright, that's good to also be aware of."
0:66:09		" Um Alright, is there anything else, do you have any questions for me or other thoughts that you'd like to share?"
0:66:19		" You were right about on time. Good. This has been, I think it's fine."
0:66:23		 Really don't use information a lot for me it's been very helpful at some point would be great is if after that um as many of us as possible could sit together?
0:66:33		" I know it's really hard to get people together and I've only been able to make it to one of the data meetings, but to go over and sort of find your your findings or the group, are you the only one doing this now or is there somebody else with Suzanne and others?"
0:66:51		" And just to talk about where we are to refine that at that point and say, well no you don't you don't you know, you don't need to use surfer any longer what everybody's using are at this point and that and that would be interesting to know in that case too, because it just strikes me that I was a little clunkier and it doesn't produce the kinds of maps that we got from surfer that I've seen so far."
0:67:10		" And it may simply be that um I did my dissertation using surfer, but I mean the equations are not complicated, you know, you just you stick them in and you let them run and that you should be able to do it on any good, any kind of software like that."
0:67:31		 So as long as the software is doing it efficiently and well and spatially spatially correct and doing all the math.
0:67:39		" Right and so on. Anyway, we don't need to take any more of your time."
0:67:44		" You didn't spill coffee twice, so that's a good thing? We didn't have to stop the recording."
0:67:49		 Yeah. So are you comfortable with what was recorded? I think so.
0:67:54		 Okay. So I think you know it under.
